# Meet-Ups

Archive of Meet-Up Topics and Resources

## Presentation Resources

It is up to the presenter how they would like to present resources. It is recommended that
each presentation have some documentation, this can be in the form of a slide deck, PDF, or 
(preferred) GitHub repo with notes/examples.

Recording the presentation is also recommended. [Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/quicktime) 
allows for recording of the screen as well as audio and is the preferred method, however, this 
is up to the presenter.

After presenting a topic, please either submit a pull request to this repository, or send your 
resources to a member of the group for archival.
